statechartEMF.properties configurations and examples
- trafficlight
- fitness

The pupose of this example is

- to present a simple (flat, non-hierarchical) statechart version that
  allows to build example statecharts from different domains (e.g.,
  traffic control, fitness exercises) where the domain is determined
  by setting appropriate names for states and for events

- to see different executions (runs) of the constructed statechart by
  building traces of alternating visited states and executed events

- to represent statecharts and runs by object models as instantiations
  of a combined metamodel for statecharts and traces in a statechart
